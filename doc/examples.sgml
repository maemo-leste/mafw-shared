<chapter id="chapter-examples">

This chapter contains a few full examples that illustrate some of the
concepts explained during this manual. The code is ready to be built
and executed to allow the reader to experiment.

In order to build these programs one should use the following command:

<para>
  <programlisting role="shell">
<![CDATA[
libtool --mode=link gcc -o <output-file> `pkg-config --cflags --libs mafw mafw-shared` <source-file>
]]>
  </programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Some of the examples require specific plugins, so be sure you have them
installed when trying to run them. Also, examples that use plugins allow
both in-process and out-of-process modes. To use the plugins in out-of-process
mode, be sure you have the plugins running using mafw-dbus-wrapper. To use
the plugins in-process, you can define the environment variable MAFW_INP_PLUGINS
to a colon separated list of plugin file paths (.so files) with the plugins to
load in this mode.
</para>

<para>
Finally, these programs should be run with appropriate environment settings,
be sure you have the &maemo; environment properly initialized and run the
programs using the run-standalone.sh script.

    <title>Source browsing example</title>

    <para>This example illustrates a simple command line program
    browsing arbitrary object identifiers using the tracker source
    plugin. To run the program successfully, one needs to have this
    plugin installed.</para>

    <para>
      <programlisting role="C"><xi:include href="examples/mafw-browse-example.c"

    <title>Source metadata example</title>

    <para>This example illustrates a simple command line program
    obtaining metadata from arbitrary object identifiers using the
    tracker source plugin. To run the program successfully, one needs to
    have this plugin installed.</para>

    <para>

    <title>Playlist example</title>

    <para>This example illustrates a simple command line program
    for creating, removing and editing the contents of playlists.
    To run the program successfully, one needs to ensure the
    mafw-playlist-daemon is running.</para>

    <para>
      <programlisting role="C"><xi:include href="examples/mafw-playlist-example.c"
      parse="text" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"

    <title>Renderer example</title>

    <para>This example illustrates a simple command line program
    for playing playlists in a renderer. To run this program
    successfully one needs to have the mafw-gst-renderer plugin
    installed and should be able to play media content using
    &gstreamer; (the reader can use gst-launch to verify this).
    One also needs to have the mafw-playlist-daemon running.</para>

    <para>
      <programlisting role="C"><xi:include href="examples/mafw-renderer-example.c"
      parse="text" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
      /></programlisting>
